# SIEM Configuration Using Microsoft Azure Sentinel
Azure Sentinel (Microsoft Cloud SIEM) Configuration

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I configured and set up a SIEM using Azure Sentinel (Microsoft cloud SIEM) to gather information on an exposed Virtual Machine in the cloud. The exposed Virtual Machine will then be configured on the internet to attrack attackers all over the world. I then configured Log Analytics in Azure and ran a PowerShell script on the Virtual Machine, to extract metadata from the Windows Event Viewer to a 3rd party API. The API then maps out geographical data of the attackers in Azure Sentinel. The purpose of the lab was to gain experience with Azure cloud services, Azure Sentinel(SIEM), Virtual Machine, PowerShell, API and Windows Event Viewer. My main goal was to learn and understand the key components of a SIEM and how they can be used to monitor and secure an organzation.
